        <h1>About</h1>
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Allie Stanich, and I'm a neurodivergent PhD studentwho is passionate about disability and neurodiversity education. The goal of this website is to provide education and advice for disabled and/or neurodivergent college students.</p>
        <p>I am currently studyng Composition and Rhetoric at Miami University, but I have a variety of research interests, including Disability Studies, Writing Center Studies, Folklore and Fairy Tale Studies, and Women and Gender Studies. In 2023, I graduated from George Mason University with a Master of Arts in English with a concentration in Folklore and a graduate certificate in Women and Gender Studies. 
            I also hold undergraduate degrees in English and Music from the University of Mary Washington.</p> 
        <p>I am extremely passionate about learning more about the stories and
            arts that bring people from all walks of life together and raising the
            voices of those who have been previously silenced.  I also have a
            love for writing, whether it be creative or academic.</p>  
        <p>I have five years of writing consultant experience three of which have been at the University of Mary Washington as
            an undergraduate, and two of which were at George Mason
            University as a master's student.  While I worked at the GMU Writing Center, I created a resource for supporting disabled and/or neurodivergent writers 
            and raised discussion about disability in the
            writing center.   I am passionate about this work because it gives me
            the opportunity to help people who may not feel confident about their
            writing, and I strive to provide them with encouragement and support
            with my consulting, bringing in my own personal experience as a
            consultant and as someone who has invisible disabilities.  Based
            on this wide array of interests, I have developed a variety of skills,
            including tutoring and writing blog posts for a company, a nonprofit
            organization, and a museum.</p> 
           <p></p>On another note, I am also passionate about the arts.  I have
            experience as a performer (choir, theatre, musical theatre, and tap
            dance) and working with others through mentoring at music therapy
            and drama therapy camps.  I love working with people and using my
            talents to help others so that they can feel like they are being heard
            and respected as individuals.</p>
