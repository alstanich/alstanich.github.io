        <h1><strong>Neurodiversity</strong></h1>
        <h3><em>What is Neurodiversity?</em></h3>
        <p><strong>Neurodiversity</strong> refers to the idea that there is diversity in how people think, learn, and process information and ideas.  Within a neurodiversity framework, the term neurodiversity is the term used to describe groups of people, but people themselves are generally seen as neurotypical or neurodivergent. 
            <strong>Neurotypical (NT)</strong> is a term used to describe people whose brains think, learn, and process information and ideas in a way that is seen as "the norm" in a particular society (and is especially commonly discussed in Western, predominantly white societies). 
            In contrast, <strong>neurodivergent (ND)</strong> is umbrella term for people whose brains think, learn, and process information and ideas in a way that is considered outside of the norm of a particular society.</p>
            <p>Neurodivergent is also an umbrella category for neurodivergent conditions.  The three neurodivergent conditions that are most frequently discussed in conversations surrounding neurodiversity are autism, ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), and dyslexia.   However, there are many other types of neurodivergence such as dyscalculia, 
             dysgraphia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), synthesia, epilepsy, Tourette's syndrome, Down Syndrome, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, chronic forms of anxiety, and chronic forms 
             of depression.</p>
             <p>It is also imporant to note that no one neurodivergent person is alike, even if they have the same diagnosis; just like how there is variation in human thinking, there is variation within neurodivergent 
                identities (including intersecting identities).  With this in mind, there is also no one way a neurodivergent person “looks” or “acts.”
